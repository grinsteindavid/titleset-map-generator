# Best Practices Guide

## ELECTRON APP BEST PRACTICES
- Use contextIsolation and disable nodeIntegration for security
- Communicate between main and renderer processes using IPC
- Handle app lifecycle events properly (ready, window-all-closed, activate)
- Optimize resource usage by cleaning up listeners and references
- Use proper error handling for file operations and IPC calls
- Cache frequently used resources to improve performance
- Implement proper window state management (position, size)

## JAVASCRIPT BEST PRACTICES
- Use const and let instead of var
- Prefer async/await over callbacks for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use destructuring for cleaner code
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions)
- Document complex functions with clear comments
- Avoid DOM manipulation in tight loops
- Debounce event handlers for performance-intensive operations
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

## PERFORMANCE BEST PRACTICES
- Minimize DOM repaints and reflows
- Optimize canvas rendering with batch operations
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Lazy-load resources and components when needed
- Compress and optimize images and assets
- Use efficient data structures for frequent operations

## CODE ORGANIZATION
- Separate concerns with modular architecture
- Group related functionality into cohesive modules
- Maintain a clear project structure with logical file organization
- Use meaningful file and directory names
- Implement consistent import/export patterns
- Document architecture decisions and component relationships
- Follow the principle of least privilege for security-sensitive code

## TESTING BEST PRACTICES
- Write focused, atomic tests that test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies and focus on unit functionality
- Separate setup and teardown logic with beforeEach/afterEach
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Use test coverage reports to identify untested code

## UX BEST PRACTICES
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Implement proper loading states and error messages
- Ensure consistent styling and layout across the application
- Make interactive elements clearly identifiable
- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Design for different screen sizes and resolutions


## UX STYLE GUIDELINES
- Use a dark, sci-fi themed color palette with blue/teal accents
- Implement isometric grid layouts for map displays
- Design HUD-style interfaces with information panels at screen edges
- Use clear iconography for different unit types and actions
- Provide audio feedback for important actions and alerts
- Incorporate minimap for navigation and strategic overview
- Design distinctive cursor states for different actions
- Support hotkeys for efficient command execution
- Use progress bars for construction/research timers
- Implement clear visual feedback for selection states
- Design modal dialog boxes with tech-inspired borders
- Ensure resource counters are prominently displayed
